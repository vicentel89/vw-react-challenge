# VW React Challenge - DataTable Application

**Developer:** Vicente Losada

## Project Overview

This application implements a DataTable component with full CRUD operations, search functionality, and sorting capabilities as part of the VW DIGITAL HUB Frontend technical challenge.

## Behaviors Documentation

As part of the development process, a comprehensive behaviors specification has been created in the `BEHAVIORS.md` file. This document defines the expected behaviors of the application using Given-When-Then scenarios, covering:

- Core data management operations
- CRUD functionality
- Search and sorting features
- State management requirements
- UI/UX interactions and error handling
- Essential edge cases

These behaviors serve as a foundation for both implementation and testing, ensuring all requirements are clearly defined and testable.
