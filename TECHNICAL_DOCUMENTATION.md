## Design System

### Custom CSS Token System

The project uses a custom CSS token system implemented through CSS variables. This approach provides:

- **Design consistency** across all components through centralized color palettes, typography scales, and spacing units
- **Maintainability** with a single source of truth for design tokens
- **Flexibility** to adapt the design system without refactoring individual components
